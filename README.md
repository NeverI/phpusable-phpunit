# PHPUsable
## Motivation
The goal of this project is to provide a more usuable syntax ontop of PHPUnit, while still being compatible with PHPUnit.

Much of the inspiration for the DSL and syntax is drawn from the ruby testing framework [RSpec](http://rspec.info/).

## Team
This library was created by the [Mover](http://mover.io) team for use in testing our PHP code base when we got tired of the PHPUnit syntax.

## Expectations
PHPUsable uses [Esperance](https://github.com/esperance/esperance) to offer an expectation based syntax for assertions.
